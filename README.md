# Title: Tuberculosis X-Ray Classification: Detecting TB with Deep Learning

## Description:
The Tuberculosis X-Ray Classification project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of accurately identifying Tuberculosis (TB) from X-ray images. Tuberculosis remains a significant global health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and disease management.

This project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically curated for TB chest X-ray images, provided by Tawsifur Rahman. The dataset contains a diverse range of X-ray images depicting both normal cases and instances of TB infection. Leveraging this dataset, the CNN model will undergo rigorous training to learn and distinguish the characteristic patterns associated with TB in X-ray scans.

By harnessing the power of deep learning, the Tuberculosis X-Ray Classification model aims to provide healthcare professionals with a valuable tool for expedited and accurate diagnosis of TB. Through automated analysis of X-ray images, this model has the potential to assist medical practitioners in identifying TB cases promptly, facilitating timely intervention and treatment.
